Here you can find a Bokeh app that will allow you to visualize the history of Nobel prizes.

You can see it runnig [here](https://nobel-laureates.herokuapp.com/nobel).

You can manipulate the visualization with differents filters like whether the laurates is a woman (and you can see how few of them) or how many laureates are alive or if the prize was shared

You can also change the X axis between countries or affiliations and the Y axis between categories and decades.
